# MATLAB_STORM_Processing
A collection of MATLAB codes for image processing, from '../elastic_aligned' to publishable data

This repository was created on 5.28.2020. The purpose was to make these codes convenient to manage and easy to share/edited by others. 

So far the repository contains: 
./Tools: 
  Two files to render MATLAB connect components data (the6y are structures with PixelList and PixelValues) into images, to be visualized in Fiji. 
 
./code_for_paper2015: 
  Original code. 

./4_color
  A series of codes desiged for the 4-color STORM imaging (2 synaspes + Vglut2 + Ctb)
  Including filter for the soma, identification for the clusters, pairing of clusters, and calculation of distance. 
  Some of the folders have a 'Random' package to randomize the data to verify the pairing result reliability. So far all random results are quite different from the raw data.
